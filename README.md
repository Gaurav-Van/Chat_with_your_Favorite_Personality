# Chat_with_your_Favorite_Personality
This project presents a chat interface, constructed using the GEMINI API. Simply pose a question, and the interface will respond, mimicking the personality selected by the user. This is a very basic project, primarily created to explore and experiment with the capabilities of the GEMINI API.

Just a Simple and very very basic web app. I just wanted to use Gemini API and Google AI Studio.<br><br>
